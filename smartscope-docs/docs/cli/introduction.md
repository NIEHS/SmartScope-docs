This section describes the commands that are available via the terminal for SmartScope. Some of the commands are used by the program through the web interface or the imaging process but others are only avaiable here.

When running via docker all of the commands can be accessed via the following initial form:

```
./smartscope.sh run COMMAND arg1 arg2 ...
```
