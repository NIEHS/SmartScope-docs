## Creating a new function-based plugin

An algorithm can be wrapped into a function to run within SmartScope. It is required to provide an output that SmartScope can read and use.

A basic wrapper goes as follows, it take a Montage class as the minimal argument as well as the kwargs necessary to run the function from the configuration file:

```python
def mywrapper(montage:Montage, *args, **kwargs) -> Tuple[List,bool,dict]:
    # excexute your code here on the image
    output = myAlgorithm(montage.image, **kwargs)
    #logic to convert_ouputs
    success = bool#check that the method provided the right outputs
    additional_output = dict()#if any other outputs that may be useful are returned
    return outputs, success, additional_output
```

### Accepted output formats


- List of center coordinates `i.e. [[x1,y1],[x2,y2],...]`
- List of boxes with upper-left and lower-right corners, `i.e. [[x1ul,y1ul,x1lr,y1lr],[x2ul,y2ul,x2lr,y2lr]]`
- coordinates can be provided as numpy arrays, `i.e.[np.array([x1,y1]),np.array([x2,y2]),...]`

### additional_ouptut

This is currently a placeholder for additional_outputs that may be used by smartscope when/if provided. The format with be a dict of values where specific keys will be used. More on this soon...


## Creating a new class-based plugin


Class-based plugins are similar to function-based plugin with more flexibility. The first part is to subclass from one of the plugin classes that meets your algorithm's :

- Finder
- Classifier
- Selector
- Finder_Classifier


All of these classes stem from the BaseFeatureAnalyzer class shown below:

::: lib.Datatypes.base_plugin.BaseFeatureAnalyzer
    options:
        heading_level: 3
        show_root_heading: True
        show_source: True
        show_if_no_docstring: True

The properties are the same that can be set in the configuration.yaml file for a plugin. The `run()` method will be called when the plugin is being run so this is the main method to override when creating a class-based plugin.

### Example

Here is the example of how the ptolemy hole finder was created.

```python
from Smartscope.lib.Datatypes.base_plugin import Finder
from Smartscope.lib.montage import create_targets_from_center, Target
from typing import Optional, Dict, Any, List, Tuple
from pathlib import Path
import numpy as np

class PtolemyHoleFinder(Finder):
    description: str = 'Hole finder that uses the ptolemy hole finder to find the holes at medium magnification.'
    reference: str = 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01534'
    kwargs: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = { 
        'model_path': Path(__file__).resolve().parents[1] / 'weights/211026_unet_9x64_ep6.torchmodel',
        'cuda': False,
        'height': 1024,
    }

    def run(self, montage, create_targets_method=create_targets_from_center)-> Tuple[List[Target], bool, Dict]:
        """Where the main logic for the algorithm is"""
        from .wrapper import ptolemy_find_holes         
        exposure = ptolemy_find_holes(montage, **self.kwargs)
        ptolemy_image_coords = np.array([exposure.crops.center_coords.y*exposure.scale,exposure.crops.center_coords.x*exposure.scale],dtype=int).transpose()
        targets = create_targets_method(ptolemy_image_coords,montage)
        return targets, True, {'lattice_angle': exposure.rot_ang_deg}
```
