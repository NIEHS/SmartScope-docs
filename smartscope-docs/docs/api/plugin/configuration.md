# Plugin configuration
    
The configuration of each plugin is provided as a yaml file in the `config/smartscope/plugins/` directory. The configuration will depend widely upon the integration method (class or function).

The fastest way to build a plugin is by writing a function. In this case more information will be required in the configuration.

Plugins can also be provided as a class. In this case, more information can be built directly into the classe, which makes the configuration file shorter.

Here is a list of all the fields that can be used in a configuration.yaml file:

- name: `string` `(required)`

    This is the name of the plugin. This will be used in the database entries to refer to a specific plugin. 
    The name should not be changed after use as it may break the references and would require a database migration of all the entries.

- importPaths: `list`

    If any paths need to be added to the PYTHONPATH to import the modules for the plugin. `i.e. importPaths: ['/opt/smartscope/external_plugins/ptolemy/']`

- description: `string`

    This is used to provide a description of the plugin on the web interface for the users to see

- reference: `string`

    Reference to the publication for the given algorithm. This is currently not rendered on the web interface but will be added soon.

- kwargs: `dict`

    A list of default arguments to provide to the run function. Values can be set directly in the wrapper function but this provides an easy place to change defaults.

## Specific to class-based plugin

- pluginClass: `string` 
  
  If providing the plugin as a class, this value should be set.

## Specific to function-based plugin


- module: `string`

  The module from where the function will be imported `i.e. module: Smartscope.lib.Finders.AIFinder.wrapper`

- method: `string`

  The function name `i.e. find_holes`

- targetClass: `list`

  The type of plugin that should be initialized. For algorithm that provide multiple outputs such as a Finder/Classifier combo, then 2 values can be provided.

  - Finder
  - Classifiers
  - Selector

## Specific to Classifiers

- classes: `dict`

    Description and colors scheme for all the possible classes in a classifier. Each possible class is a key that contains a dict of 3 entries:

    - classLabel: `dict`

        - name: `string`
        
            Name of the class that will be displayed on the web interface
        
        - value: `int`

            Usually 1 or -1 whether the class should be included or excluded from the selection pool.

        - color: `str`

            CSS color name or hex value for the display of the class on the web page.

## Specific to Selectors


- clusters: `dict`

    How to display the different clusters of values.

    - values: `acsending|descending`

        How to sort the clusters

    - colors: 

        A list of CSS color name or hex value the display different clusters. `['blue', 'lightblue', 'CornflowerBlue', 'blueviolet', 'purple', 'white']`

- exclude: `list` 

    A list of clusters to exclude by default from the target selection.
