## Update from 0.9.1 to 0.9.2

To ensure that all the new files and permissions are working properly, we advise installing v0.9.2 in a new location and synchronizing the database from v0.9.1. 

!!! note "Advantages of a fresh install"

    A fresh install will minimize potential update issues. 
    It will also provide a fallback option in case anything doesn't work out during the 0.9.2 installation.

1. Backup the v0.9.1 database.

    ```shell-session
    docker compose exec -it smartscope
    mysqldump --user=$MYSQL_USER --password=$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD $MYSQL_DATABASE > /mnt/backups/0_9_1_backup.sql'
    exit
    ```

2. Turn off the 0.9.1 instance.

    ```shell-session
    ./smartscope.sh stop
    ```
    
3. Create a new installation directory

    ```shell-session
    mkdir SmartScope_0-9-2
    cd SmartScope_0-9-2
    ```

4. Follow the [installation procedure](/getting_started/installation/docker/docker) for the `latest` version.


5. Copy over your `database.conf` and `smartscope.conf` from your 0.9.1 installation.


6. Copy over the database backup to the new directory.

    ```
    cp /path/to/0.9.1/backups/0_9_1_backup.sql backups/
    ```
    
7. Launch smartscope.

    ```shell-session
    ./smartscope.sh start
    ```

8. Use the new [database restoration](/cli/maintenance_commands/#restore-database) command.

    ```shell-session
    ./smartscope.sh run restore_db 0_9_1_backup.sql
    ```

9. Restart smartscope.

    ```shell-session
    ./smartscope.sh restart
    ```

## Update to 0.9.1

To update to 0.9.1 from any prior version. There is one setting that needs to be updated:

1. Open database.conf and change the MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD entry and rename it to MYSQL_PASSWORD:

Original file:
```
MYSQL_USER=root
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=pass
MYSQL_DATABASE=smartscope
MYSQL_HOST=db
```
Should become:
```
MYSQL_USER=root
MYSQL_PASSWORD=pass
MYSQL_DATABASE=smartscope
MYSQL_HOST=db
```

## Update to 0.8

If you whish to update from 0.7 to 0.8 or higher, we strongly recommend using the [new installation procedure](/getting_started/installation/docker/docker) and moving over the settings from the original docker-compose.yml into the new structure to ease any future update.
