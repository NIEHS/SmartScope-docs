## Update from 0.9.1 to 0.9.2

Please download the new `smartscope.sh` script which allows new commands.

```
cd /your/smartscope/installation/directory/
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NIEHS/SmartScope/stable/Docker/SmartScope/smartscope.sh
```

## Update to 0.9.1

To update to 0.9.1 from any prior version. There is one setting that needs to be updated:

1. Open database.conf and change the MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD entry and rename it to MYSQL_PASSWORD:

Original file:
```
MYSQL_USER=root
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=pass
MYSQL_DATABASE=smartscope
MYSQL_HOST=db
```
Should become:
```
MYSQL_USER=root
MYSQL_PASSWORD=pass
MYSQL_DATABASE=smartscope
MYSQL_HOST=db
```

## Update to 0.8

If you whish to update from 0.7 to 0.8 or higher, we strongly recommend using the [new installation procedure](/getting_started/installation/docker/docker) and moving over the settings from the original docker-compose.yml into the new structure to ease any future update.
