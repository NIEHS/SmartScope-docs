To accomodate for Falcon detectors which have hard-coded frames root directory, the frames directory can be set seperately from the Microscope 
with the `Frames windows directory` and `Frames directory`. If you are not using a Falcon detector, it is recommended to set this value to the same as for the microscope
with the addition of `/movies`. As with the example above, it would become `Frames windows directory= X:\\smartscope\movies` and `Frames directory= /mnt/krios/smartscope/movies`
