## Register a microscope to the SmartScope database

Now that the connection to SerialEM works, we can add our microscope to the database.

To do so, navigate to the [admin portal](/getting_started/administration/admin_panel) and then the Microscopes section and add microscope. It should bring you to [localhost:48000/admin/detector/add/](localhost:48000/admin/microscope/add/).

Then follow the instructions on how to [add a microscope](/getting_started/administration/microscope)

## Register a detector to the SmartScope database

!!! warning 
    
    Each microscope must have least one detector.

Similarly to adding a microscope, navigate to the admin portal and then the Detectors section and add. It should bring you to [localhost:48000/admin/detector/add/](localhost:48000/admin/detector/add/).

Then follow the instructions on how to [add a detector](/getting_started/administration/detector)
