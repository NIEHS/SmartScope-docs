    These steps should be performed daily for best performaces

There are a few steps performed within SerialEM prior to running SmartScope.

1. Load the SmartScope settings file that contains the Low-dose presets and imaging conditions. Guidelines on how to set up this file are found in the [Post-installation steps](/post-install/serialem/low_dose/).

2. Align the beam and correct astigmatism and coma, as per your usual procedures.

3. Align your Record -> View -> Search image-shifts.
    
    This is the same way as for any SerialEM experiment. It applies image shift to keep the registration between the magnification levels. This ensures proper targeting.

4. Open the imaging states.

    You should have a mont-map imaging state pre-saved. Double-click it to enable it.

5. You're all set!
