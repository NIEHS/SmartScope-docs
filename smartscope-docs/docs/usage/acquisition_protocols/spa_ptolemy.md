### Unique features

- This is the most simple and powerful protocol in SmartScope.
- We're using the hole finder from the Ptolemy package, which allows to find the holes at medium (View) mag. This allows the following advantages:

    - No need for a hole template.
    - Holes are re-registered between the square and the View mag. This makes the coordinates more precise.
    - Beam-image-shift radius can be extended and still allow for multi-shot per hole at large distances.
