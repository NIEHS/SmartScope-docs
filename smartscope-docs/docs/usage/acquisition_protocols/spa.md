## SPA protocol

!!! note

    This is the original protocol from SmartScope. It doesn't use any external libraries.

The SPA protocol requires a hole template reference saved in the `References` directory in the Smartscope directory of SerialEM PC.

The file should be a cropped image from the View preset, centered on a hole.

Save the image from SerialEM as `holeref.mrc`.

!!! note

    A good hole reference from a UltrAUfoil or similar gold foil grid can be re-used for most sessions.

    The only time the holeref.mrc needs to be swapped is when using a different hole size.
