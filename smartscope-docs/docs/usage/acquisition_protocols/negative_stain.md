### Unique features

- This protocol is used to screen and acquire data on Lacey carbon, Negative stain grid or other non-holey grids.
- Instead of attempting to find holes, a regular lattice of targets is layed on top of the squares and are used as targets.

    The lattice spacing is 5 um.

- There is no hole recentering at the medium magnification either.
